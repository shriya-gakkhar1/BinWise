# BinWise ♻️

**A conceptual project developed as part of the Generation Green Internship**

BinWise is an all-in-one digital platform designed to make waste segregation in urban spaces *smart*, *sustainable*, and *engaging*. Though it's a prototype born from imagination, it reflects a real-world vision: transforming civic waste management from a reactive chore into an active community-driven movement.
